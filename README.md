# CaveGenerator
A simple program that can be used to generate random caves for the Pikmin 2. It's very basic right now, and only features a few of the enemies and treasures 
which can be spawned in a map.
When run, it will ask for a seed (inputting "0" will randomly generate a seed). Then, the program mimics the file structure that the developers used with random values.
The cave will be placed in the local directory "caves".

Enjoy!
